Sample GAN implementaion that uses the MNIST data to generate synthetic handwritten digit images. 


## Dependencies
* Anaconda 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* Keras
    * Matplotlib.pyplot
    * Numpy

## Installation
* Install [Anaconda 3](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* Create a new environment using the Anaconda Navigator
* Install Keras in the new environment; 
    * Numpy and Matplotlib.pyplot should automatically install as dependency packages

## Training the GAN
* Launch Jupyter Notebook from the navigator; Make sure you're in the environment where Keras is installed
* In the Jupyter Notebook web app, start a new terminal instance
* Once in the terminal, navigate to the directory with the gan.py file and run with the following command
    * `python gan.py`
